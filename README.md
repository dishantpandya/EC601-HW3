# EC601-HW3
This is as a part of Boston University College of Engineering course EC601:Product Design in ECE.


Exercise 1:
Mat.data gives a pointer which refers to the original data matrix. In this data matrix, all the pixel values are stored in 1D array. i.e. b1,g1,r1,b2,g2,r2 and so on. Images in OpenCV are stored in the format of BGR and not RGB. So, if we have an image having 512x512 pixels, pixels in first row and first column will have some value like b00, g00 and r00. As per this the pixel in nth row and mth column will have values bnm, gnm and rnm.


Exercise 2:
The values of the pixel at (20,25) in the RGB, YCbCr and HSV versions of the image:
    
    1.RGB=[106 122 225]
    2.YCbCr=[151 181 103]
    3.HSV=[4 135 225]
